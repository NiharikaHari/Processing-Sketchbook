### The Coding Train - Coding Challenges

In Coding Train Challenges/ folder you will find sketches made by me in Processing using Java, Python and Javascript.
Below is a list of them:
1. **Bounce1**: A sketch to display physics mechanics of bubbles bouncing. There is also sound integration as when you click on a bubble a sound plays and the bubble divides into two. All bubbles created continue bouncing around the screen
2. **DepthFirstSearchMaze**: Uses depth first search algorithm to create a maze
3. **Fractal_Tree_15**: Draws a fractal tree where the user can control width and height of the tree using mouse position.
4. **JuliaSet_22**: Coding the Julia Set fractal
5. **LorenzAttractor_12**: Visualise lorenz attractor - The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations and the Lorenz Attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of this system. This sketch is also audio-reactive with the sketch reacting to a song inputted in the code.
6. **LSystemTree_16**: Draws fractal trees using the L-system
7. **MandelbrotSet_21**: Visualises the Mandelbrot set. The user can control the limits and scale of the values used, creating different effects
8. **Perlin3DTerrain_11**: Generates 3D terrain using Perlin Noise
9. **PerlinNoise_24**: Creates a particle flow field using perlin noise
10. **purple_rain**: An animation of a house on a hill with trees and purple rain
11. **Reaction_Deffusion_13**: Visualises a reaction diffusion simulation using the Gray Scott model
12. **SnakeGame**: A basic snake game :]
13. **SpaceColonization3D_18**: Generates a tree structure in 3D using space colonization algorithm
14. **SpaceColonizationTree_17**: Generated a tree structure in 2D using space colonization algorithm
15. **SphericalGeometry_25**: Constructs a sphere in 3D from scratch using triangle strips
16. **SuperEllipse_19**: Draws super ellipse shape where parameters are controlled by the user using sliders
17. **SuperShapes2D_23**: Draws super shapes in 2D and is audio-reactive. The shapes change in response to the song.
18. **SuperShapes3D_26**: Draws super shapes in 3D where the shape parameters can be controlled by the user.
